2% Ethics in 
Finance 
In the Week 1 tutorial, students will be introduced to Ethics in Finance 
through a special Moodle Module. For this tutorial, students should bring 
their laptop computers. 
 
The Ethics in Finance module must be completed by Monday of Week 7. Late 
completion will result in a zero grade.  
 
The content of Ethics in Finance is examinable in Quiz 2. See below.  
 
5% Tutorial 
participation 
Tutorial participation is a grade given by your tutor. There are two ways to 
participate in the tutorial that students should develop: (1) answering tutor’s 
or other students’ questions competently and professionally, and (2) asking 
thought provoking questions that develop greater insight for the whole 
tutorial group.  
 
Students will be asked to do a self-assessment of their tutorial participation 
after the Week 5 tutorial. Tutors will then give students a preliminary tutorial 
participation grade before the Week 7 tutorial. Students will then have a 
chance to improve their grade until the end of Term. If there is a significant 
improvement (or deterioration), the final Tutorial participation grade may be 
increased (or decreased), otherwise it will remain unchanged.  
 
Students will also be asked to assess their peers’ contribution to the Team 
Problem Solving of their small tutorial group. There is no grade attached to 
the peer assessment.
