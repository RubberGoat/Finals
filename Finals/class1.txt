company but not outside of it.

Franklin was in a hurry to get a client’s order transacted. He quickly checked 
the stock trading price and placed the order. After the client received the 
contract note, they checked it against the market report and found that he had 
paid more for the stock because it went ex-dividend the day after the purchase 
— he was going to get a dividend which would be taxable. What grounds 
might the client have for a complaint? 
 
A. He has no complaint as there was no instruction to Franklin to purchase the 
stock ex-dividend. 
B. He could complain that Franklin was not diligent in his actions — Franklin 
should have known that it was going ex-dividend the next day. 
C. It would depend on whose idea it was to purchase the stock on that day.  
D. It is not Franklin’s duty to the clients to consider the taxation implications of a 
transaction. 
 
14 
Why is common law such an important factor for licensees and financial 
planners? 
 
A. The common law provides superior pre-trial mediation. 
B. The client can get other clients to join them in a class action in common law, 
but not with statute law. 
C. Common law processes can be faster and more certain than complaining 
to ASIC and/or the FPA. 
D. All of those reasons. 
 
15 
Cheryl was involved in a very bad car accident. She received a compensation 
payout of $450,000. Her condition was expected to deteriorate over time and 
this money had to last her for over 20 years. Thom, a financial planner, 
knowing the money had to last, recommended a share portfolio that paid good 
franked dividends. Was this good advice? 
 
A. Yes, because she has a long investment timeframe and the portfolio and 
income stream is expected to grow over time and meet her rising income 
needs. 
B. No, it is not appropriate because it does not take into consideration her need 
for high levels of income now. A balanced approach would provide higher 
income now and still provide an expectation of inflation protection for the 
assets and income over time. 
C. There is not enough information to decide. 
D. It will depend on the how the market performs over the next few years. 
 
16 
What impact do disclaimers on disclosure documents have? 
 
A. No use whatsoever 
B. Very limited, but can’t hurt 
C. Can be used as a warning to clients ©

17 
Why might an annual review be more work than an initial plan?  
 
A. There is a year of monitoring, review and performance to cover. 
B. The clients may be less enthusiastic about reviews than the initial planning. 
C. If markets have turned down there may be a lot of client education required. 
D. All of the above and more.

Sustra is a doctor in private practice. She earns a good income and has to pay 
a lot of tax. Her financial planner has put her into a number of tax reduction 
strategies, and she has heavily borrowed to fund these strategies. Each year 
to lower her tax bill, she borrows more. What is the key issue with this 
strategy? 
 
A. She needs to have good income protection insurance so that if she could not 
earn a living she would still be able to meet her payments. 
B. Even with her high income, she may not be able to raise 
additional debt each year. 
C. At some point, the level of debt she has will make her uncomfortable and 
she may not be able to unwind without taking significant losses. 
D. Investing purely for ‘tax’ management is not an appropriate strategy. She 
should be investing using an appropriate asset allocation and specific asset 
selection. 
 
19 
Why do breaches of ethical standards, as opposed to breaches of strict legal 
requirements, pose a business risk to financial planning businesses? 
 
A. Trust is at the heart of successful business relationships and is not earned 
with low ethical standards, even if there are no legal breaches. 
B. ASIC will expect best practice to be exhibited when they audit a company. 
C. Ethics is concerned with client relationships, an area in which the law is not 
involved.  
D. Best practice will normally become the law eventually, so it’s safer to get in 
first. 
 
20 
What levels of research are you required to undertake before you recommend 
a product? 
 
A. As long as the product is on your licensee’s Approved Product List it 
is not necessary to do any further research. 
B. If a reputable research house rates a product highly, the adviser can take that 
at face value. 
C. You must do sufficient research on products within your authorisation and 
which are on your licensee’s Approved Product List to be able to match the ©

D. It is sufficient to provide the PDS for the product to the client as the PDS must

order to make an investment decision.

Answer grid.  
 
1. C.  
While all of the answers are correct to some extent, the key issues for compliance are 
based on consumer protection. 
 
2. D.  
As all of the investment money is the client’s money, both commissions and fees for 
service will reduce the amount of money available for investment. The concern is that 
financial planners will support products that pay higher commissions rather than 
those that meet the client’s needs. 
 
3. A.   
The way financial planners act in regards to compliance is set by top management. 
Where managers see their businesses as client centric, they will attract and reward 
planners who put their clients’ interests first. 
 
4. C.  
It is often important for one financial planner to discuss issues and strategies with 
another planner. However, in doing so, it must be on a generic basis — the client’s 
confidentiality must always be maintained. 
 
5. B  
While each of these statements identifies issues, the key conflict that a financial 
planner faces is that they have obligations to both their licensees and to their clients, 
and the interests of each may not always align. For example, licensees may require 
high fees to generate business revenue while the client’s interest is in low fees so that 
more of their money is invested. 
 
6. B.  
While RG146 does required the licensee to ensure that they hire competent financial 
planners and that these planners keep up to date, RG146 sets to establish a level of 
education and training which meets clients’ expectations for professionalism. 
 
7. D  
Students should be asked to list/discuss other additional methods. 
Having a reasonable basis for advice is the most critical part of financial planning. 
 
8. B.  
While APRA generally has little direct responsibility for financial planners, if the 
licensee is part of a multi-faceted financial business, prudential reporting at the group 
level will include the financial planning business. 
 
9. C.  
The misleading or deceptive definition is very broad; it makes no difference 
whether the intent was to mislead or deceive, or even if anyone was actually 
misled or deceived. It is how the conduct affects thoughts and beliefs that matters. 
If the overall impression left by an advertisement, promotion, quotation, statement 
or other representation could create a misleading impression in the mind — such

an
as to the price, value or the quality of any goods and services — then the conduct 
is likely to breach the law.  
 
10. C.  
Sammy has to take full responsibility for the parents agreeing to sign. He should 
know that while, over time, the portfolio may grow to more than cover the loan, there 
are potentially margin calls which the parents would be required to meet if his young 
client was not able to. 
 
11. D.  
As he has been guilty of providing inappropriate advice, not doing his research and 
perhaps acting outside of his authorisation, most licensees would view him as a 
compliance risk and it is very unlikely that he would be offered work in any capacity. 
 
12. D.  
While decisions on the matters detailed in A–C need to be considered, the key to 
meeting your obligations is thorough data collection, analysis and continuous 
monitoring of client accounts. Know your client and you will meet your money 
laundering obligations. 
 
13. B.  
Even if it was the client’s decision to purchase the stock, Franklin owed him a duty of 
care to check important aspects of the stock before the transaction was made. If he 
had been diligent, he could have advised the client to wait until the stock went ex-
dividend before he purchased it. 
 
14. C.  
As common law is based on duty of care, and it is clear that a licensee and a financial 
planner generally owe the client a duty of care, common law can be faster, more 
certain. Proving duty of care and breach of that duty is often easier than seeking 
redress through the Corporations Law and ASIC. 
 
15. B.  
Investment recommendations must be based on the income needs of the client now 
and in the future. The advice is inappropriate, no matter how the market performs, 
and the portfolio is too risky for this client. More information would be required to 
support a full recommendation but there is no question that 100% in equities is too 
aggressive for someone in this position.  
 
16. C.  
Disclaimers do not provide a lot of legal protection, as you cannot disclaim away a 
consumer’s legal rights. However, when constructively used, disclaimers can alert 
the client to areas of volatility, uncertainty and assumptions which may change. In 
this way, they can be effective in warning the client to pay attention to the detail of 
their financial plan. 
 
7. D.  
Students should be encouraged to list/discuss other reasons why annual reviews may 
be harder work than the initial plan and think of ways to get clients committed to an 
annual review process. ©

18. D.  
While each of the answers has merit, the fundamental issue is that the 
investments are being  made not so much because they are appropriate, but purely 
to save tax. Tax-effective investments usually carry higher risk than others. If they 
stacked up on their merits against competing investments, the government would 
not need to forego any tax to encourage people into them.  
 
19. A.  
Students need to understand the relationship between compliance and business 
management. A ‘just get by’ business strategy means that significant business risk is 
being taken, often without the company even realising it. 
 
20. C. 
Product research is one area where many financial planners are not well trained. 
However, they are required to be personally diligent in researching products before 
they recommend them to clients and not rely solely on research houses, the PDS 
or the fact that a product is on the Approved Product List.

A taxpayer chooses not to repair the roof on his factory (cost of $5000) but instead 
replaces the whole roof at a cost of $15,000. What is the correct response 
below? 
 
A. The taxpayer can claim the outgoing expense of replacing the roof as a repair which 
is deductible against his income. 
B. The taxpayer has substantially replaced part of the structure; this is a capital outgoing 
and not deductible. 
C. The taxpayer paid less when acquiring the factory, therefore subsequent repairs 
should be deductible.

Question 4

Question 5 
Which of the following has the effect of lowering the ATI? 
 
A. A tax deduction 
B. A tax offset 
C. Salary sacrificing to superannuation 
D. Creating a loss through negative gearing 
 
 
 
Question 6 
A partnership is an excellent method of reducing overall tax since income can be spread over 
many participants, including all family members. 
 
A. Partnerships may come under ATO scrutiny if income is being distributed to persons, 
including family members, who are not really working in the partnership. 
B. Partnerships are primarily used, particularly in family circumstances, because there 
are no capital gains payable.

Question 7 
A business may be held within a trust which allows for business income to be distributed to 
various beneficiaries. 
 
A. The trust is useful since if no income is distributed then no tax is payable. 
B. The trustee is the only party liable for tax on a trust. 
C. Where a minor receives income from a trust they will normally be taxed at penalty 
rates.

Answer Grid 
 
1.  
A. Not correct, replacement is a substantial change to the structure of the asset which is            
of a capital nature and is not deductible, except through depreciation.  
B. Correct, substantial changes are capital and not deductible under the negative limbs. 
C. Incorrect, paying less for an asset means that a capital item is purchased at a  
discount and subsequent spending on the structure is part of the capital expense. 
D. Incorrect, even though something can be repaired, if it is replaced, then it is classed  
as capital expenditure; there is no allowance for pro rata repairs.  
 
2. 
A. Not correct, she can only claim running expenses as a proportion of the house; 
general expenses such as rates and interest are personal and not deductible. A home 
study can be claimed, not a home office. 
B. Not correct, she can claim expenses available for a home study. 
C. Not correct, the house is a capital asset but the running expenses of a home study 
are deductible. 
D. Correct, recurring expenses that relate to the study such as lighting, heating and 
cooling are available to a taxpayer who has a home study. 
 
3. 
A. Not correct, a diary is not required in either case. 
B. Not correct, a diary is required in both cases.  
C. Not correct, written evidence is required in both cases.  
D. Correct, a diary is not required for either domestic or international travel of less than 
six nights in a row, and for all other travel both written evidence and a diary is 
required.  
4. 
A. Not correct, an offset is not a deduction but actually lowers the tax itself directly. 
B. Correct, an offset directly reduces tax payable for particular taxpayers when 
spending on very particular categories of outgoings.  
C. Not correct, not every taxpayer can claim an offset, much depends on the offset 
claimed and many of these require some qualification such as level of income or 
numbers of family members.  
D. Not correct, offsets are available for a variety of categories; eg, the Medicare offset is 
available if a taxpayer on a high income takes out private insurance.  
5. 
A. Correct, taxable income is a component of the ATI and taxable income is lowered by 
tax deductions. 
B. Not correct, tax offsets reduce tax payable but do not reduce any component of the 
ATI.  
C. Not correct, reportable superannuation contributions are part of the ATI, so switching 
money from assessable income to superannuation contributions will not change the 
ATI.  
D. Not correct, net investment losses are added back to ATI, so creating a loss through 
negative gearing will not be effective in reducing the ATI. 
6. 
A. Correct, where a partnership is used to alienate income then the distribution of 
income may be disallowed. 
B. Not correct, partnerships are used in a variety of relationships and participants will be 
subject to capital gains tax. 
C. Not correct, a partnership can be a small business if it qualifies under the STS 
criteria. ©

D. Not correct, partnerships do not pay tax nor distribute dividend; individual partners 
pay their own tax from their individual receipts. 
 
7. 
A. Not correct, either the trustee or the beneficiaries must pay tax, unless there is some 
special situation concerning the beneficiaries, eg, as an orphan. 
B. Not correct, the beneficiary pays tax if presently entitled, or else the trustee is liable. 
C. Correct, minors who receive distributions will pay at high marginal rates as this is a 
form of alienation – unless there is dispensation granted by the ATO. 
D. Not correct, losses from trusts can only be offset against gains from the trust, not 
against any other gains.

Answer Guide 
 
1. C. See pg 434 
2. B.  Workings: $400,000 x 80% = $320,000 less original debt of $280,000 = 
$40,000 
3. B. Workings: Enter to Excel or a financial calculator PV = 350,000; i = 7.2%/12 
= 0.006, n = 5yrs x 12mths = 60 
4. B.  Workings: 
Month 1 2 3 4 5 6 
Opening 
Balance 
5,000.00 4,781.25 4,573.91 4,373.82 4,180.74 3,994.41 
Interest 75.00 71.72 68.61 65.61 62.71 59.92 
Min 
Payment 
293.75 282.65 272.13 261.97 252.17 242.72 
Balance 4,781.25 4,570.32 4,370.39 4,177.46 3,991.27 3,811.61 
 
5. C.  Workings: 
Month 1 2 
Opening Balance $500.00 206.67 
Plus Interest $ 6.67 2.76 
Total payment $300.00 209.42 
Balance $206.67 - 
Saving = $600 - $500 – ($6.67 + $2.76) = $90.58 
 
6. D. See pg 450–1 
7. A. Workings: $5000 x 0.045 = $225 
8. B. See pg 452 
9. A. See pg 447 
10. D.  Workings: Interest = 70,000(1+ (10%/12))12 - 70,000 
11. A.  Workings: $20,000((1+5%)/12)60 = $25,667, which is the best result. 
12. C. See pg 456 
13. D. See pg 460-4 
14. C.  Workings: An LVR of 75% means that Chen’s debt as a percentage of the 
total value of his portfolio cannot go above 75%. Therefore if Chen already has 
$50,000 of his own money, he can purchase a portfolio up to $50,000/(1-0.75). 
15. D. Workings: 70% of $80,000 = $56,000. Margin loan currently at $60,000, 
therefore margin call issued for $60,000 ? $56,000 = $4,000 
16. B. See pg 463 
17. A.  Workings: 
 Salary  90000
